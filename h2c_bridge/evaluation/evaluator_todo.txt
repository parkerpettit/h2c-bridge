"""
Note: Due to the large size of the evaluator file (~500+ lines),
I'm creating a placeholder reference. To create the full evaluator:

1. Copy lines 865-1001 from original file for H2CEvaluator
2. Copy lines 1004-1373 for H2CMMLUEvaluator

These files contain the full evaluation logic for:
- OpenHermes loss evaluation
- Demo generation
- MMLU accuracy evaluation
- Baseline evaluation
- Answer extraction logic

For now, import from the original file or see the implementation plan.
